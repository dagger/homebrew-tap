## How to fix a broken tap? ðŸš°

On February 20, 2025 we rewrote the git history since a pre-release snuck it by
mistake, and we also fixed some artefact SHAs due to a separate problem - #7.

Unfortunately, this git rewrite broke the tap. To fix it, you can run the
following:

```console
brew untap dagger/tap
brew install dagger/tap/dagger
```
